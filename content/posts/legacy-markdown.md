# Legacy Markdown Support

This post is written in a standard `.md` file, not `.mdx`.

## Why support both?

Migration from other systems (Jekyll, Hugo) often involves thousands of `.md` files. Supporting them natively makes migration easier.

## Footnotes

Footnote test[^test].

One of the main benefits of `.md` support is seamless migration. If you're moving from Jekyll, Hugo, or another static site generator, your existing posts can be dropped into the `content/posts/` directory without any changes. Frontmatter fields like `title`, `date`, and `tags` are parsed identically for both formats.

The key difference is that `.mdx` files allow embedding React components directly in your content, while `.md` files stick to standard Markdown. For most blog posts, standard Markdown is more than sufficient — and keeping your content in `.md` means it stays portable across any Markdown-compatible system.

### Code Block Test

```javascript
console.log("Hello from .md file!");
```
