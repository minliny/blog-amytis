# Amytis

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

**Amytis** is a powerful, elegant, and user-friendly open-source digital garden framework for building knowledge spaces, blogs, showcase sites, or internal knowledge bases. It is built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and Bun, emphasizing a Markdown-first, plain-text-first workflow that preserves long-term content ownership while pursuing simplicity, elegance, and performance.

## Why Amytis?

I have been [blogging for twenty years](https://hutusi.com/archive), starting from early blogging platforms such as MSN Space (MS Live Space) and Sina Blog, then moving to self-hosted WordPress and Drupal, and later fully adopting static blogging frameworks after GitHub Pages became available. I tried Jekyll, Hugo, and several of their themes, but none of them truly satisfied me. The feature-rich ones were often not simple or elegant enough, while the elegant ones usually lacked flexibility and customization. I kept wondering whether a blogging or knowledge platform framework could balance functionality, performance, aesthetics, and UX. That idea stayed with me for years. When I finally decided to build one myself, I found it much harder than I had expected.

Fortunately, AI coding changed that equation. With the help of Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex, it became much easier than before to turn the idea into reality. After more than 700 commits of iteration, Amytis finally took shape as the idealized knowledge platform framework I had been aiming for. It was first used in the geek community platform I built at work, and I also replaced the framework behind my Hutusi blog with it. Amytis is now open source. Independent bloggers and knowledge managers are welcome to use it, and contributions, bug reports, and pull requests are all appreciated. If you are using Amytis, feel free to leave a note in [this issue](https://github.com/hutusi/amytis/issues/49).

### The Knowledge Ladder

Amytis is built around a path from fragmented thoughts to refined knowledge, helping individuals or teams build a complete digital garden system:

- **Flow**: Capture daily thoughts and brainstorming fragments.
- **Articles**: Refine a single idea into a clear article.
- **Series**: Connect related articles into a thematic narrative.
- **Books**: Distill mature knowledge into structured, chapter-based books.

Each stage builds on the one before it, so the garden can grow naturally.

### Design Philosophy

- **Elegance by default**: Typography, spacing, and color should feel polished out of the box and remain visually consistent.
- **Content and plain text first**: Writing and publishing should happen through file-based workflows rather than a heavyweight CMS. Content lives in Markdown/MDX, can be versioned with Git, and remains portable over time.
- **Markdown-first, not markdown-limited**: Markdown and common extensions are supported by default, while math, diagrams, code, and bidirectional links remain first-class.
- **Ship what you need**: `site.config.ts` provides modular switches so you only enable the capabilities you actually need.

## Quick Start

### New Project (Recommended)

Scaffold a new Amytis site with one command:

```bash
bun create amytis my-garden
cd my-garden
bun dev
```

The scaffold command downloads the latest tagged Amytis release, installs dependencies, and patches `site.config.ts` and `package.json` with your project metadata.

### Clone & Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   > **Search in dev:** the Pagefind index is generated during `bun run build:dev`. Run it once before testing Cmd/Ctrl+K locally, and re-run it after content changes.

3. **Build for Production (Static Export):**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   The static site will be generated in the `out/` directory with optimized images.

4. **Development Build (faster, no image optimization):**
   ```bash
   bun run build:dev
   ```

## CLI Commands

```bash
## Core
bun dev
bun run lint
bun run build:graph
bun run validate

## Build & Deploy
bun run build
bun run build:dev
bun run clean
bun run deploy                 # Deploy to Linux/nginx server (requires .env.local)

## Test
bun test
bun run test:unit
bun run test:int
bun run test:e2e
bun run test:mobile

## Create Content
bun run new "Post Title"
bun run new-weekly "Weekly Topic"
bun run new-series "Series Name"
bun run new-note "Concept"
bun run new-flow

## Import / Maintain
bun run new-from-pdf ./doc.pdf
bun run new-from-images ./photos
bun run new-flow-from-chat
bun run import-obsidian
bun run import-book
bun run sync-book
bun run series-draft "series-slug"
bun run add-series-redirects --dry-run
```

### Importing Chat Logs to Flows

Drop `.txt` or `.log` files into `imports/chats/`, then run:

```bash
bun run new-flow-from-chat
```

Common flags: `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--author "Name"`, `--append`, `--timestamp`.
Import history is stored in `imports/chats/.imported`.

## Configuration

Primary site settings live in `site.config.ts`. `site.config.example.ts` is the reference template used by the scaffold and is useful when reviewing new options:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // ...
  nav: [
    { name: "Home", url: "/", weight: 1 },
    { name: "Flow", url: "/flows", weight: 1.1 }, // Add Flows to nav
    { name: "Series", url: "/series", weight: 1.5 },
    { name: "Books", url: "/books", weight: 1.7 },
    { name: "Archive", url: "/archive", weight: 2 },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
  flows: {
    recentCount: 5,
  },
};
```

High-impact areas to customize first:

- Site identity: `title`, `description`, `baseUrl`, `ogImage`, `logo`
- Navigation and footer: `nav`, `footer`, `subscribe`, `social`
- Content behavior: `posts.basePath`, `posts.includeDateInUrl`, `series.autoPaths`, `series.customPaths`
- Homepage composition: `hero`, `homepage.sections`
- Integrations: `analytics`, `comments`, `feed`, `i18n`

For static hosting behind nginx, start from `nginx.conf.example`.

## Static Export Routing Rules

Amytis is built around Next.js static export with `output: "export"` and `trailingSlash: true`.

- In `generateStaticParams()`, return raw segment values. Do not pre-encode with `encodeURIComponent`.
- Link to concrete URLs such as `/posts/中文测试文章`, not route placeholders like `/posts/[slug]`.
- Posts default to `/<posts.basePath>/<slug>` and `posts.basePath` defaults to `/posts`.
- If `series.autoPaths` is enabled, series posts move to `/<series-slug>/<post-slug>`.
- If `series.customPaths` is configured, those custom prefixes override `autoPaths`.
- Before moving series posts off the default posts path, run `bun run add-series-redirects --dry-run` and then `bun run add-series-redirects` so legacy URLs still resolve.

## Writing Content

### Posts

Create `.md` or `.mdx` files in `content/posts/`.

- Flat file: `content/posts/my-post.mdx`
- Date-prefixed file: `content/posts/2026-01-01-my-post.mdx`
- Folder post with co-located media: `content/posts/my-post/index.mdx` plus `content/posts/my-post/images/*`
- CLI: `bun run new "Post Title"` or `bun run new "Post Title" --folder`

### Flows

Create daily notes in `content/flows/YYYY/MM/DD.md` or `.mdx`.

- CLI: `bun run new-flow` creates today’s entry
- Chat import: put exports in `imports/chats/` and run `bun run new-flow-from-chat`

### Series

Create a directory in `content/series/<slug>/` with an `index.mdx`, then add posts as sibling files or folders.

- CLI: `bun run new-series "Series Name"`
- You can also create a post directly inside an existing series with `bun run new "Post Title" --series <series-slug>`

### Books

Books are long-form structured content under `content/books/<slug>/`.

- Keep book metadata in `index.mdx`
- Add chapter files beside it, for example `introduction.mdx` or `setup.mdx`
- Use `bun run import-book` and `bun run sync-book` for book-oriented workflows

### Notes

Create evergreen notes in `content/notes/` (for example `concept.mdx`). Use `[[wiki-links]]` to connect them.

- CLI: `bun run new-note "Concept"`
- Unicode slugs are supported intentionally for notes and posts where needed
